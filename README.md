# Tula Designs Co Website Backend Code

Status: This is the backend code for the tuladesignsco website that is under construction. The last contribution was in march, work is still being done to complete the website. 

Final Project Idea:
- to connect the front end to a database that collects customer information and their orders.
- each time an order is placed an email is sent to our website indicating that an order was placed, and its information.
- log in service - so that customers can log into their accounts for the website and shop based on their history
- payment processed through paypal that connects to the business bank account.
